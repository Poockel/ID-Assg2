### My project is the snake game which is a very popular game created at 1997 as a form of entertainment on the Nokia phone when forms of entertainment was scarce.

## Design Process
### I wanted to re-create the game that many people have enjoyed in the past. Even though the game is simple, it is very entertaining which is my goal for this project, to create a simple yet entertaining game that brings nostalgia for elderlies and a quick form of entertainment for young adults and children.
