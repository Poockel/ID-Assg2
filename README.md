#### My project is the snake game which is a very popular game created at 1997 as a form of entertainment on the Nokia phone when forms of entertainment was scarce.


## Design Process
#### I wanted to re-create the game that many people have enjoyed in the past. Even though the game is simple, it is very entertaining which is my goal for this project, to create a simple yet entertaining game that brings nostalgia for elderlies and a quick form of entertainment for young adults and children.


## Features
### Existing Features
#### Feature 1) User can press arrow keys up, down, left and right to control the movement of the snake.
#### Feature 2) User can control the snake to eat the apple which would increase the length of the snake, making the game more difficult, and increase their score.
#### Feature 3) Score system which allows user to keep track of their score.
#### Feature 4) When the user allows the snake to hit the border of the arena or the snake body, the user loses.

### Features Left To Implement
#### Feature 1) Login system which allows users to store datas of their attempts.
#### Feature 2) A high score system which allows users to see their high scores and boast to their friends.
#### Feature 3) Other game modes which spices up the game and make it more fun e.g. faster snakes, time rush, 1v1 duels.


## Technologies Used
#### html, css and javascript.


## Testing
####  Snake Game
####    i. Try to purposesly control the snake to hit the border and verify that the game over alert shows up.
####    ii Try to control the snake to eat an apple and verify that the score goes up according to the number of appls eaten.
####    ii. Try to eat enough apples so that the snake is long enough to hit its body and verify that the game over alert shows up.

#### The game works perfectly on devices with height and width more than or equal to 500 pixels.

#### One bug I found was that sometimes when the snake hits the border, it goes through the border until it disappears before game over alerts show up.
